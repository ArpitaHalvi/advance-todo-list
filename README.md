To-Do List App


This is a simple yet functional to-do list app built with React, where users can add tasks, set priorities, and manage them effectively. Tasks can be added by typing into the input field, selecting a priority, and clicking the "Add" button. The app allows you to:

Delete individual to-dos.
Mark tasks as completed.
View tasks organized by categories (priority).
